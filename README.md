### a.a. 2017-2018 software engineering 2 project

_Project developed by Franklin Onwu, Ivan Sanzeni and Matteo Vantadori_

Many endeavors require scheduling meetings at various locations all across a city, whether in support of a mobile job or a busy parent. The goal of this project is to create a calendar interface that automatically computes and accounts for travel time between appointments to make sure that you're never late for an appointment.
