SCENARIOS

Tom is a student who recently moved to Milan for his studies. He is a messy boy and always had his events scattared on post-its all over the house. This condition often made him miss appointments. His roommate, tired of the disorder presented to him Travlendar+, a new born application suitable for situations as Tom's.
Tom enthusiastically downloaded the application and after a quick registration via facebook he transferred all the events he had hanging around in his Tlavlendar+ app.
He was alerted when events where set in a contrasting period and always notified in time for his events.
In few days he gladly noticed how having all his events always under control brought an improvement in his daily routine organization. Even Carlo was happy, he could finally throw away all the post-it notes.

Knowing that the market starts at 8.00 a.m. and lasts until 5.00 p.m. he schedules a new flexible event in the mentioned hours and sets an occupation time of thirty minutes, time he will need to use to find the best pots for his mum. On wednesday the idea of the present was already out of his mind when, after a busy morning Travlendar+ notified him that he had the free time to spend at the market.

Every year in Milan there is an electronics fair where you can find cards, headphones, storage devices and other stuff. This expo lasts a week, and Michael is a fan of this kind of things. So, he schedules a new lasting event specifying the days of beginning and end.
The first day’s event a notification is popped up, advising Michael that, during the day, there are events, but he is very busy and can’t go anywhere. The day after another notification is showed. This time he has some free time in the afternoon, so, instead of deleting the notification/*invece di eliminarla fa “ricordamelo dopo”->funzione da aggiungere da qualche parte? */, he keeps it as reminder. In the early afternoon he wants to go there, taps on the pop up and sets the usual parameters needed to reach a location, then the travel starts.

6.	//compra biglietti
Carl is going to have a long trip across Milan in the afternoon and he really needs the support of Travlendar+. He inserts a new event and choose to use only subway and tram to reach his destination, specifying that he already has a subway subscription. At the specifying time before the departure, a notification advises and shows him the route to follow: first tram, then subway and again tram. Before that Carl can start the trip, Travlendar+ warns him that he must have to buy 2 tram tickets, if he does not already have, to follow the route suggested. Carl doesn’t have cash with him, so he purchases the tickets with the buy-in-app utility inserting the pin of his credit card. A few moments later a mail notify the success of the operation. Now Carl can start his trip.
