Every year in Milan there is an electronics fair where you can find cards, headphones, storage devices and other stuff. This expo lasts a week, and Michael is a fan of this kind of things. So, he schedules a new lasting event specifying the days of beginning and end.
The first day’s event a notification is popped up, advising Michael that, during the day, there are events, but he is very busy and can’t go anywhere. The day after another notification is showed. This time he has some free time in the afternoon, so, instead of deleting the notification/*invece di eliminarla fa “ricordamelo dopo”->funzione da aggiungere da qualche parte? */, he keeps it as reminder. In the early afternoon he wants to go there, taps on the pop up and sets the usual parameters needed to reach a location, then the travel starts.
